# SQL-and-Python-Music-Analytics-Decision-Making (Work in Progress)

Data analytics project using the Spotify API (Spotipy) to collect tracks, audio features, and popularity, exploring genre/year trends and what drives song success.

---

## Overview

This project analyzes how songs gain popularity on Spotify by combining **audio features**, **artist/album metadata**, and **popularity scores** from the Spotify Web API.  
It includes extraction with **Spotipy**, structured storage with **SQL**, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and consulting-style visualizations.

**Key questions**
- Which artist has the most albums? 
- Which genre has the highest total plays? Which genre has the most listeners?
- In which year were the most albums released?
- Which song is the top performer by total plays? (Top 1 / Top 5)
- Which artist has the highest total plays? (Top 1 / Top 5)
- Among even-year releases in the selection, which album performs best by total plays? (Top 5)
- Which artist has the longest active career span, and how many albums do they have?
